  - "After meeting on a night out in West Hollywood, a young Kiwi Lad and a young Brazilian Boy came up with the idea that they would some day open a place, combining everything they missed about their homelands- Their Mothers cooking, their favorite street foods and the most delicious coffee. Wrap it all up with the hospitality their Mums taught them so well and Bakers & Roasters was born."
  - "B&R is a New Zealand style café served with a heavy dose of Brazil right here in Amsterdam. The open kitchen produces all your favourite brunch dishes, fresh fruit salads, and kiwi-twisted baked goods all day long. All our cakes are made in-house and our Ozone coffee is always served as doubles."
