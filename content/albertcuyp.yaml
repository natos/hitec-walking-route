  - "The market began trading in 1904, now over 300 stalls are lining both sides of the Albert Cuyp street in the neighborhood ofÂ De Pijp. Stalls sell everything from fruit, vegetables, cheese, fish and spices to clothes, cosmetics and bedding. The prices are among the cheapest in Amsterdam. The market gets very crowded especially on a sunny day and Saturdays."
