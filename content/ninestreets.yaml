  - "The Nine Streets - De Negen Straatjes is in the heart of Amsterdam’s canal district and is one of the city’s most delightful shopping areas. Just two minutes walk from the Royal Palace in the Dam Square, these picturesque streets straddle the 17th Century canals from the Singel to the Prinsengracht."
  - "Spend a fabulous day wandering from one to the next exploring the designer boutiques, art galleries, jewellers, gift shops, fashion shops and specialist businesses - there are plenty of great bars, cafes and restaurants to refresh you along the way."
